# ip-reflector-service
A personal project inspired by https://ipchicken.com. I've been using that site for years and I love it. I thought it would be a fun project to throw together.

Reads the X-Forwarded-For header instead of the source address and it's designed to work inside of a container in google run.

Eventually I'll re-release a version of this as a crate that's ready to go out of the box with your own templates.
